### 13.2 Compare and contrast a hash table and an STL map. Hos is a hash table implemented? If the number of inputs is small, which data structure options can be used instesd of a hash table?

In a hash table, a value is stored by calling a hash function on a key. Values are not stored in sorted order. Additionally, since hash tables use the key to find the index that will store the value, an insert or lookup can be done in amortized 0(1) time (assuming few collisions in the hash table). In a hash table, one must also handle potential collisions. This is often done by chaining, which means to create a linked list of all the values whose keys map to a particular index.

An STL map inserts the key/value pairs into a binary search tree based on the keys.There is no need to handle collisions, and, since the tree is balanced, the insert and lookup time is guaranteed to be O(log N).

**hash table : array + hash funciton(key)**

**STL: red-black tree**

- hash table 要处理好冲突，使key分布比较均匀

- 无论哈希函数有多好，仍然有可能有冲突

- 不要轻易改变hash table大小

- 当数据比较少时，可以用STL map。
