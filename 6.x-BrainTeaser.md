You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.

Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

20个瓶子，有19个瓶子装的都是1克的药片，另外1个瓶子装的都是1.1个的药片，有一个能天平能测量出精确的重量，只能用一次来找到哪个瓶子装的是1.1克的药片。

#### 6.1 solution
Firstly, number the bottles as #1, #2, ..., #20
Secondly, as there is only one bottle that is 0.1 gram heavier than others, we can pick out different pills in that rule:
bottle #1, 1 pill
bottle #2, 2 pills
...
bottle #20, 20 pills
Add all of them above, and substract (1+2+...+20) = 210, e.g. the result is 1.1, then is the bottle #11 thats have 1.1 grams pills.


给瓶子编号，1到20，对编号为x的瓶子取出x个药片，总和减去210，余数乘以10就是装这1.1克瓶子的编号。

### 6.2
There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

8 * 8的棋盘，对角线的两个角被切去。诺骨牌是面积为2的矩形，能否用31个诺骨牌来覆盖被切去两个角的棋盘？

#### 6.2 solution:
Very skillful, color the chess to 32 white and 32 black, since the opposite corners must be the same color, so after removing such two corners, it may be 30 white and 32 black left. Any domino covers one black and one white, so it could be impossible.

很巧妙，给棋盘上色，32白32黑，因为是对角，所以颜色一定相同，假设是30白32黑，而每一块诺骨牌总是占一黑一白，所以不可行。

### 6.3
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

3夸脱和5夸脱的容器各一个，如何量出4夸脱的水

#### 6.3 solution:
Old question. I had seen it several years ago.

Firstly, fill 5-quart up. Then, pour 5-quart into 3-quart until it is full. At that time, it's 2 quart left in 5-quart jug.And then, empty the 3-quart and pour the left 2 quart into the 3-quart. Lastly, fill 5-quart jug up and pour it until the 3-quart jug full. At that time it's 4 quart left in 5-quart jug.

先把5夸脱杯子装满，倒到3夸脱杯子里，剩2夸脱。把3夸脱杯子清空，再把这2夸脱水倒倒3夸脱杯子里，把5夸脱杯子盛满水，将3夸脱杯子倒满，此时5夸脱杯子里剩下4夸脱水。

### 6.4
A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

有一群人生活在岛上，每天有一班飞机到岛上。有个奇怪的规矩，蓝眼睛的人得上飞机离开。每个人可以看见其他人眼睛的颜色，但是不知道自己眼睛的颜色。至少有一个人是蓝眼睛，问得过多少天，蓝眼睛的人才会乘飞机离开。

#### 6.4 solution:

经典题。和[白帽子黑帽子问题](http://www.jobdao.com/interview/interview_82.htm)一样。书上也有讲, 可以参考书上的解法，是一样的。

### 6.5
There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.
