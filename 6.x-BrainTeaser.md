### 6.1
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight
T.I grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find
the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

20个瓶子，有19个瓶子装的都是1克的药片，另外1个瓶子装的都是1.1个的药片，有一个能天平能测量出精确的重量，只能用一次来找到哪个瓶子装的是1.1克的药片。

#### solution
Firstly, number the bottles as #1, #2, ..., #20
Secondly, as there is only one bottle that is 0.1 gram heavier than others, we can pick out different pills in that rule:
bottle #1, 1 pill
bottle #2, 2 pills
...
bottle #20, 20 pills
Add all of them above, and substract (1+2+...+20) = 210, e.g. the result is 1.1, then is the bottle #11 thats have 1.1 grams pills.

给瓶子编号，1到20，对编号为x的瓶子取出x个药片，总和减去210，余数乘以10就是装这1.1克瓶子的编号。
