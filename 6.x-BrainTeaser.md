You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.

Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

20个瓶子，有19个瓶子装的都是1克的药片，另外1个瓶子装的都是1.1个的药片，有一个能天平能测量出精确的重量，只能用一次来找到哪个瓶子装的是1.1克的药片。

#### 6.1 solution
Firstly, number the bottles as #1, #2, ..., #20
Secondly, as there is only one bottle that is 0.1 gram heavier than others, we can pick out different pills in that rule:
bottle #1, 1 pill
bottle #2, 2 pills
...
bottle #20, 20 pills
Add all of them above, and substract (1+2+...+20) = 210, e.g. the result is 1.1, then is the bottle #11 thats have 1.1 grams pills.


给瓶子编号，1到20，对编号为x的瓶子取出x个药片，总和减去210，余数乘以10就是装这1.1克瓶子的编号。

### 6.2
There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

8 * 8的棋盘，对角线的两个角被切去。诺骨牌是面积为2的矩形，能否用31个诺骨牌来覆盖被切去两个角的棋盘？

#### 6.2 solution:
Very skillful, color the chess to 32 white and 32 black, since the opposite corners must be the same color, so after removing such two corners, it may be 30 white and 32 black left. Any domino covers one black and one white, so it could be impossible.

很巧妙，给棋盘上色，32白32黑，因为是对角，所以颜色一定相同，假设是30白32黑，而每一块诺骨牌总是占一黑一白，所以不可行。
