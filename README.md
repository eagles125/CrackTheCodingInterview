=======================

Where I get the Crack-The-Coding-Interview book online?

[CrackTheCodingInterview][1]

If you still can't download it, email me and I will send you one copy.


Key in resume:
Are you smart?
Can you code?
***
Limit the content to the best, most impressive, most relevant items.
Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z.
Try to make the results "measurable" somehow.

Projects,(whether it is academic project, course project) what it is, language, individual or a team project.
Course Projects / Independent Projects

- Try to solve the problem on your own.
- Write the code for the algorithm on paper.
- Type your paper code as-is into a computer.

Data Structures and Algorithms

Be Specific, Not Arrogant.

Structure the responses using S.A.R. : Situation, Action, Response.

So when you get a hard question, don't panic. Just start talking aloud about how you would solve it.

1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.

2. Design an Algorithm.

3. Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you're writing pseudo-code.

4. Write your code, not too slow and not too fast.

5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes.
